	<h2>Highlights from my work at the San Francisco Chronicle</h2>
	<p>My internship at the SFC opened my eyes to the kind of work that's possible combining my editorial background with coding skills. As a result, I'm looking for similar opportunities work across newsrooms, digging deep into data retrieval/analysis/visualization as well as designing and implementing creative ways of visual storytelling.</p>
	<p>These are some of the best pieces I contributed to and/or implemented. For more detailed explanations, <a href="/coding/sfcwork">see here</a>:</p>

	<h2><a target="_blank"  href="https://ericayee.com/seaport/">Boston's Closed Port</a> | <span><code><a href="https://github.com/ericayee/seaport">GitHub repo</a></code></span></h2>
	<p>My classmates <a target="_blank" href="https://www.danaebucci.com/">Danae Bucci</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cindella204">Jasmine Heyward</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JasmineWu_">Jasmine Wu</a>, and I conceived and executed this project for the journalism course Coding for Digital Storytelling at Northeastern University during January - April 2019. I personally wrote the introduction and coded the attractions and transportation maps. I'm especially proud of how the transportation map turned out with the animations and scrollytelling (i.e., routes appear when you scroll to the relevant paragraph in the written narrative). I only had minimal JavaScript experience prior, and this was the first time I used the D3 and Leaflet libraries. Most of the actual code for the animations came from this extremely helpful <a target="_blank" href="http://zevross.com/blog/2014/09/30/use-the-amazing-d3-library-to-animate-a-path-on-a-leaflet-map/">tutorial</a>, which I tweaked for our needs. Through this project, I learned a lot about web development and integrating interactive elements using HTML/CSS/JavaScript elements to tell a cohesive story.</p>

	<h2>Bostonography: Data analysis and visualization using R | <span><code><a target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/ericayee/bostonography">GitHub repo</a></code></span></h2>
	<p>In my Spring 2019 <a target="_blank" href="http://bostonography.benschmidt.org/index.html">Bostonography</a> course, I learned how to apply computational methods to cultural, historical, and society questions about Boston. I became well-versed in using R for data cleaning and visualization through the assignments for this course, especially the tidyverse and ggplot libraries. Here are a few of my Rmarkdown projects:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ericayee/bostonography/blob/master/libraries.md">Exploratory Analysis of Boston Public Library Data</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ericayee/bostonography/blob/master/ev_data.md">Analysis of Massachusetts Offers Rebates for Electric Vehicles (MOR-EV) Program Data</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ericayee/bostonography/blob/master/EricaYee_Not_Reading.md">Not Reading a Boston Biography</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a target="_blank"  href="https://ericayee.com/quotes/">Quote Generator</a> | <span><code><a href="https://github.com/ericayee/quotes">GitHub repo</a></code></span></h2>
	<p>This personal project is a random generator of quotes I've collected over the years that are thought-provoking, relatable, moving, or just beautifully written. I used simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>
	<p><em><strong>Update 5/29/19:</strong></em> I refactored this project as my first foray into the JavaScript library React.</p>

	<h2>Analyzing #GoldOpen Tweets with R | <span><code><a target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/ericayee/GoldOpen-Tweets">RMarkdown</a></code></span></h2>
  <p>For my first foray into R, I adapted <a href="http://www.storybench.org/build-animated-map-tweets-nba-finals-r/" target="_blank">this Storybench tutorial</a> about mapping NBA finals tweets to look at #GoldOpen tweets using the rtweet package. That hashtag was used in a social media campaign to ensure a successful opening for the film "Crazy Rich Asians." Take a look at the markdown file linked above for how I graphed the tweets over time and mapped them.</p>

	<h2>Developing a Composite Measure: Restfulness | <span><code><a target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/ericayee/restfulness/blob/master/restfulness_report.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a></code></span></h2>
	<p>For my Spring 2019 course Empirical Research Methods, I developed a survey about restfulness and distributed it to my classmates. I analyzed the resulting data using Python and the pandas, matploblit, and scipy libraries.</p>
