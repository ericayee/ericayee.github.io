	<h2><a href="https://ericayee.com/seaport/">Boston's Closed Port</a> <span><code><a href="https://github.com/ericayee/seaport">code</a></code></span></h2>
	<p>My classmates <a target="_blank" href="https://www.danaebucci.com/">Danae Bucci</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cindella204">Jasmine Heyward</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JasmineWu_">Jasmine Wu</a>, and I conceived and executed this project for the journalism course Coding for Digital Storytelling at Northeastern University during January - April 2019. I personally wrote the introduction and coded the attractions and transportation maps. I'm especially proud of how the transportation map turned out with the animations and scrollytelling (i.e., routes appear when you scroll to the relevant paragraph in the written narrative). I only had minimal JavaScript experience prior, and this was the first time I used the D3 and Leaflet libraries. Most of the actual code for the animations came from this extremely helpful <a target="_blank" href="http://zevross.com/blog/2014/09/30/use-the-amazing-d3-library-to-animate-a-path-on-a-leaflet-map/">tutorial</a>, which I tweaked for our needs. Through this project, I learned a lot about web development and integrating interactive elements using HTML/CSS/JavaScript elements to tell a cohesive story.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://ericayee.com/quotes/">Quote Generator</a> <span><code><a href="https://github.com/ericayee/quotes">code</a></code></span></h2>
  <p>This personal project is a random generator of quotes I've collected over the years that are thought-provoking, relatable, moving, or just beautifully written. I used simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://github.com/ericayee/GoldOpen-Tweets">Analyzing #GoldOpen Tweets with R</a></h2>
  <p>For my first foray into R, I adapted <a href="http://www.storybench.org/build-animated-map-tweets-nba-finals-r/" target="_blank">this Storybench tutorial</a> about mapping NBA finals tweets to look at #GoldOpen tweets using the rtweet package. That hashtag was used in a social media campaign to ensure a successful opening for the film "Crazy Rich Asians." Take a look at the markdown file linked above for how I graphed the tweets over time and mapped them.</p>
