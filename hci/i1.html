<h1>IS 4300: I1: Individual Assignment #1: Brainstorming</h1>
<h3>Erica Yee</h3>

    <strong>Syllaby</strong>
    <p>At the beginning of each semester, I go through each of my class syllabi and add assignments and exams to a central schedule organizer (such as Trello). This manual method is time-consuming and liable to human input error. Assignment due dates may also change, requiring revisions. I would like a syllabus builder that allows professors to input content for students to use the way they want, such as transferring all the assignment dates directly to Google Calendar. Having all the course syllabi in one central online location and format could help students work more efficiently, rather than having to download documents from Blackboard. If a professor changes an assignment, the interface could notify students and change the calendar accordingly.</p>

    <strong>Deals With It</strong>
    <p>As a senior, I’ve learned over the years of the many discounts and free resources and experiences available to me as a Northeastern student. These deals range from free admission to the Museum of Fine Arts to free copies of Microsoft Office Suite. However, information about them are scattered around and can be hard to discover except through stumbling across them or word-of-mouth. A central searchable database of these deals would be helpful for students to make the most of their experience at Northeastern.

    <strong>SubsForStudents</strong>
    <p>For one of my classes this semester, I have to buy a subscription to a certain software package. This got me thinking about all the other subscriptions I pay for, from music and other streaming services to news. A central subscription tracker could help me see how much I’m spending each month and/or year and when the bills are due. There could also be a functionality to keep track of the ones a user is splitting with friends/family. Though this concept is generally useful, it could be more student- and even Northeastern-specific by suggesting services that offer student discounts.</p>

    <strong>NU Gameday</strong>
    <p>I’m interested in attending Northeastern sports games, but I never know when they are. The schedules for varsity, club and intramural games are on different websites and difficult to navigate quickly. This information could be pulled together in an interface that’s easily searchable by sport, location, date, etc. The app could include game notifications, and or include a way to directly add events to Google Calendar or other calendar applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>SustaiNU</strong>
    <p>Northeastern touts its commitment to environmental sustainability as shown through facilities and class curricula requirements. However, in my daily life as a student, I still don’t know how to sort my trash and recycling at Rebecca’s Cafe. I propose an app that shows students eco-friendly and sustainability initiatives specific to Northeastern and student life. The app could encourage taking these actions through a gamified habit tracker. Collecting actions would require further research, but some examples off the top of my head include using Northeastern’s community herb gardens, donating unwanted belongings to Trash2Treasure, and even using a water fountain on campus to refill a bottle.</p>

    <strong>particip8</strong>
    <p>As a research university, Northeastern has many opportunities for students to both contribute to research as well as take part as participants. The stalls in campus bathrooms are often plastered with ads looking for participants, and many students may be looking to make side money through such studies. There could be an online portal where researchers could post their ads with eligibility criteria. Students or other people in the community can see if they qualify to participate and then contact the researcher through the portal.</p>
