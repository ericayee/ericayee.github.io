          <h6><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/">San Francisco Chronicle</a> |  Aug 2019</h6>
          <p>data analysis & back-end development | <span class="i">Python</span></p>
          <p>The Chronicle dev team has put out several trackers the last few years, including wildfires and car break-ins. Near the end of my internship, I was asked to implement a “lighter,” more “whimsical” tracker for one of San Francisco’s most famous phenomenons: fog. I appreciated my supervisors wanting me to have a project I could completely own. Due to a variety of reasons (time constraints, other projects I pitched in on, my limited skills) I was unable to complete the project during my internship. However, my supervisor Evan Wagstaff was able to finish the front-end and turned the project live soon after, for which I am very grateful.</p>
          <p>After consulting a <a href="https://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/home.html">meteorology PhD student</a> who posted some tutorials on GitHub and lots of experimenting in Jupyter Notebooks, I wrote a Python script that retrieves data from the NOAA’s GOES-17 satellite, which are publicly available on <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-goes/">Amazon Web Services</a>, and converts them to images. The script initially crashed the Chronicle’s virtual computer, but eventually Evan and I managed to reduce the computing power it needed.</p>
          <p>On the design side, I originally riffed off our previous tracker template. But when one of the designers saw that idea, he reimagined it in a much more visually interesting way that I never would’ve thought of on my own. The final presentation ended up being quite close to his mockup. From this experience, I learned that I wanted to get better at thinking at design and how to approach projects before even starting to code. That’s why I signed up for an introductory design course the following semester.</p>
          <p>Overall, this project taught me that projects don’t always turn out the way you envision them at the beginning. There were even points at which I thought it wasn’t even possible because I couldn’t figure out the back-end data retrieval. But I am so grateful that the team at the Chronicle supported me and carried it through. Now I have a fun project I'm really proud of.</p>

          <h6><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/">San Francisco Chronicle</a> |  Jul 2019</h6>
          <p>design & front-end development | <span class="i">React, Gatsby ArchieML, Figma</span></p>
          <p>This piece was part of the annual SF Homeless Project in which Bay Aera newsrooms, led by the Chronicle, focus coverage on the region's homelessness crisis. After I expressed interest in gaining more experience creating mockups, my supervisor asked me to design this Q&A project.</p>
          <p>My goal was to make it clear that the Chronicle had thoroughly answered all the questions from readers, as well as make the page easy to navigate. After my design (using Figma) was approved, I coded the page using React.js and ArchieML to convert the text content from Google Docs to JSON.</p>
          <p>Since I led the design and development of this project, I learned a lot about iteratively improving based on feedback. I was also pleasantly surprised at how much time our audience spent reading this text-based project, with a significant portion even scrolling all the way to the bottom of the page.</p>
